# 🕊️ Rommy

**Rommy** is a lightweight Rust CLI app that makes pair programming with AI assistants or remote humans easier, more efficient, and more robust.  
Rommy runs Bash commands or scripts, captures all input/output, and optionally streams everything live to the terminal — with color highlighting.  
The results are saved in a structured **.rommy file** containing metadata, command details, stdout, and stderr.

The name **Rommy** is inspired by _Rommie_, the avatar of the AI of the starship _Andromeda Ascendant_ from the TV series _Andromeda_.

## ✨ Features

- 🪶 **Simple command execution**
  ```bash
  rommy run -- cargo test
  ```

Runs the command, streams live output to the terminal, and stores everything automatically.

- 🗃️ **Automatic output organization**
  If `--out` is omitted, Rommy uses a default path and filename based on time and command:

  ```
  ~/.local/state/rommy/2025/10/26/165900.cargo_clippy.rommy
  ```

- 🧭 **Smart defaults**
  Default output root follows OS conventions:
  - Linux: `~/.local/state/rommy`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Rommy`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Rommy`
  - Or override:

    ```bash
    export ROMMY_ROOT=/path/to/custom
    ```

- 🖊️ **Scratch script editor**
  If no command or script is provided, Rommy automatically opens your preferred editor (`$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL`) to create a temporary Bash script, runs it, and records the output.

- 🎧 **Live streaming with colors**
  - `stdout` and `stderr` are streamed live to your terminal while being captured to file.
  - **stderr** is shown in **yellow**, and Rommy’s own messages (e.g. “Wrote …”) appear in **cyan**.
  - Disable streaming or colors:

    ```bash
    rommy run --no-stream --color=never -- cargo clippy
    ```

- 📜 **Structured format**
  Each `.rommy` file contains:

  ```
  <<<META>>>
  timestamp: ...
  exit_code: ...
  <<<COMMAND>>>
  $ cargo test
  <<<STDOUT>>>
  ...
  <<<STDERR>>>
  ...
  <<<END>>>
  ```

- ✅ **Validation command**
  Validate one or more files/directories with text or JSON output:

  ```bash
  rommy validate logs/ --format json
  ```

- 🔎 **Show command**
  Read and display `.rommy` records in text or JSON format:

  ```bash
  rommy show logs/run.rommy --record 1 --format text
  ```

## 🚀 Installation

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Or directly from Git:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/jati-bintang/rommy
```

### Requirements

- Rust ≥ 1.85 (edition 2024)
- (optional) `bash` for script mode

---

## 🧩 Examples

### 1️⃣ Run a simple command

```bash
rommy run -- cargo build
```

### 2️⃣ Run a script

```bash
rommy run --script build.sh
```

### 3️⃣ Run interactively (no command given)

```bash
rommy run
```

→ Rommy opens your editor, you write a script, save, close — and Rommy executes it.

### 4️⃣ Custom output file

```bash
rommy run --out results/mytest.rommy -- cargo test
```

### 5️⃣ Disable live streaming

```bash
rommy run --no-stream -- cargo check
```

### 6️⃣ Validate logs (text output)

```bash
rommy validate target/tmp
```

### 7️⃣ Validate logs (JSON output, quiet text equivalent)

```bash
rommy validate target/tmp --format json
```

### 8️⃣ Show all records from one file

```bash
rommy show target/tmp/append_test.rommy
```

### 9️⃣ Show one selected record as JSON

```bash
rommy show target/tmp/append_test.rommy --record 2 --format json
```

## 📂 File format

Rommy files are both human-readable and machine-friendly.
Each file consists of well-defined blocks:

```
<<<META>>>
timestamp: 2025-10-22T15:30:45Z
exit_code: 0
duration_ms: 11234
<<<COMMAND>>>
$ cargo test
<<<STDOUT>>>
running 3 tests
test result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed;
<<<STDERR>>>
<<<END>>>
```

---

## 🧪 Validation and Exit Codes

- `rommy validate` returns exit code `0` if all matched files are valid.
- It returns non-zero if at least one file is invalid, path discovery fails, or no files are found.
- `--quiet` suppresses per-file `OK` lines in text mode.
- `--format json` emits machine-readable results while preserving exit-code behavior.

---

## 🔒 Concurrency and Writes

- Rommy writes through a temporary file and atomic rename to reduce partial/corrupt outputs.
- For concurrent writers targeting the same output file, Rommy uses a lock file (`.<name>.lock`) to serialize writes.
- `--append` uses copy-on-write + atomic replace under that lock, so appended records remain consistent.
